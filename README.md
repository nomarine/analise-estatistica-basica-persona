# Statistical Analysis with Persona
A personal project for statistical analysis elaborated to exercise what I learned about it using the Persona game franchise as my study object.

Points explored:  
- Use of Pandas to calculate Measures of Central Tendency and Measures of Dispersion;
- Use of Seaborn for ploting histograms and boxplots;
- Frequency distirbution;
- Mean, median and mode;
- Percentile;
- Variance, Standard Deviation and Coefficient of Variation.
